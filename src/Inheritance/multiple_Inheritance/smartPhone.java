// we can't extend multiple classes , because what if all the super classes have the same name method..
// if that's the case then when we will create the child class object and calls that method , that will cause ambiguity...
// So,that is the reason multiple Inheritance is not allowed in JAVA ...
// we can solve this issue using the interfaced based approach which we will study later on ...
